# Real-time Parking Slot Occupancy Detection
## Introduction
This repository contains two different codes:
* [notebook](notebook)
* [implementation](implementation)

The idea of the project concerns parking occupancy detection. The central theme of this project is the creation of a model that is able to identify in real-time, using images/videos of a real car park, which spaces are free and which are occupied. The idea will be to use Deep Learning techniques to create a model that returns the output in real-time, so that the identification of free/occupied slots occurs in a short time. As a dataset I was thinking of using the following dataset: http://cnrpark.it
