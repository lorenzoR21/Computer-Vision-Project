# Real-time Parking Slot Occupancy Detection
## Introduction
The idea of the project concerns parking occupancy detection. The central theme of this project is the creation of a model that is able to identify in real-time, using images/videos of a real car park, which spaces are free and which are occupied.
This repository contains two different parts:
* [notebook](notebook): this folder contains the main notebook [] which concerns the creation and training of the model to classify the occupancy of parking slots in real-time.
* [implementation](implementation): this folder contains the implementation of an Android mobile app for searching for available parking slots and a script that uses the previously trained model to communicate, in real-time, to all app users which slots are free and which are occupied using video coming from a real parking camera.
